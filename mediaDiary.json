I have so much _fun_ fighting monsters and using flashy weapons.\n- Intriguing storyline and characters. \n- Repetition is rewarding, and God Mode makes it easier to progress."

			"gameDesc": "I am spending a _lot_ of time playing Destiny 2, which is addictive because I get to satisfy my desire to Acquire More Things. I'm pretty terrible at it because I haven't done much FPS gaming, but I like that I can do low-key things like meander around planets and kill enemies in small batches at a time. "
